Let a given set of prime numbers between 0 and 10  be A
A={ 2, 3, 5, 7}
let a given set B, be set of odd numbers from 0 to 10
B={ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
let a given set C, be set of squares between 0 to 10
C={ 0, 1, 4, 9}
Now find the set D, set of union of all sets A, B, C
D ={ A 𝗨 B 𝗨 C} = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9)
Now find the set E, set of intersection of all sets A, B, C
E ={ A 𝗻 B 𝗻 C} = { }
If cardinality of D > E, then print TRUE.
